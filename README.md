# Tic Tac Toe Game

This Python Tic Tac Toe game is a simple console-based application developed as part of my journey to explore Python as a developer.

## Overview

Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game where the objective is to place your symbol (X or O) on a 3x3 grid and form a line of three symbols either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. This game project was developed to understand Python programming and logic while creating a fun and interactive application.

## Features

- Player vs. Player (PvP) mode
- Player vs. CPU (PvC) mode
- Player symbol selection
- Interactive grid display
- Real-time feedback on player moves
- CPU opponent with random moves
- Determination of game outcome (win, tie)

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Clone or download this repository.
3. Open your terminal/command prompt.
4. Navigate to the project directory.
5. Run the game by executing the Python script: `python tictactoe.py`.
6. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.

## Game Modes

- **Player vs. Player (PvP):** Two players take turns using the same computer.

- **Player vs. CPU (PvC):** Play against a CPU opponent. The CPU makes random moves.

## Symbol Selection

- Player 1 gets to choose their symbol: X or O.
- Player 2 (in PvP mode) or the CPU (in PvC mode) will be assigned the other symbol.

## Development Purpose

This project was created as part of my exploration in Python development. It allowed me to:

- Gain familiarity with Python syntax and programming concepts.
- Implement a simple console-based game with user interactions.
- Explore conditional statements and loops.
- Develop basic game logic and user interfaces.

Please note that this project serves primarily as a learning exercise and a demonstration of Python skills. It is not intended to be a fully featured Tic Tac Toe application.
